The word clock is derived (via Dutch, Northern French, and Medieval Latin) from the Celtic words clagan and clocca meaning 'bell'. A silent instrument missing such a striking mechanism has traditionally been known as a timepiece. In general usage today a 'clock' refers to any device for measuring and displaying the time. Watches and other timepieces that can be carried on one's person are often distinguished from clocks." android:textSize="15dp" android:layout_margin="10dp" /></LinearLayout>
